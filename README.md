## My process

### ðŸš€ Technologies

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive media queries

### What I learned

I have some other projects using JS and importing icons, in this particular project I have downloaded and incorporeted these icons in CSS. Also my initial works are from a Mobile background, hovering styles are not something I'm used to work. In this case I needed a shadow and hover effect, the codes below provide an ideia of that:

```html
<a href="">
  <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i>
</a>
```
```css
.info button {
  background-color: white;
  color: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: 0.3s;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}

.info button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
  color: white;
}
```
