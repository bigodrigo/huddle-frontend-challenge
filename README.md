### What I learned

I have experience with other projects involving JS and importing icons. In this current project, I have downloaded and incorporated these icons into the CSS. Additionally, my previous work has mainly been focused on Mobile applications, so I am not as familiar with creating hovering styles. However, in this case, I needed to implement a shadow and hover effect. The code snippets below outline the implementation for achieving this effect.

```html
<a href="">
  <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i>
</a>
```
```css
.info button {
  background-color: white;
  color: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: 0.3s;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}

.info button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
  color: white;
}
```
